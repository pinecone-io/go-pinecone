# Testing Patterns

**2 test types:** Unit tests (fast, no external dependencies) and Integration tests (real Pinecone API, `testify/suite`). Both live in the same `_test.go` files, separated by comments (`// Unit tests:` and `// Integration tests:`).

**Unit tests:**
- Function naming: Must end with `Unit` (e.g., `TestNewClientParamsSetUnit`)
- Use `testify/require` for fatal assertions, `testify/assert` for non-fatal
- No real API calls, no external dependencies
- Run with `just test-unit`

**Integration tests:**
- Methods on `integrationTests` suite struct (which embeds `suite.Suite`)
- Run with `just test` (requires `.env` with credentials)
- Two suites run in parallel: serverless and pod-based indexes
- Suite setup/teardown in `pinecone/test_suite.go`; entry point in `pinecone/suite_runner_test.go`

**Local integration tests:**
- Build with `-tags=localServer`
- Run against Docker-based local Pinecone servers (ports 5081/5082)
- Used in CI (see `.github/workflows/ci.yaml`)

**Test organization:** Tests live alongside the code they test (e.g., `client_test.go` tests `client.go`).
