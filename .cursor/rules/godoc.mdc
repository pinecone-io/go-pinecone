# GoDoc Documentation

All exported identifiers require GoDoc comments. The comment **must start with the name** of the symbol.

**Format:**
```go
// Client holds the parameters for connecting to the Pinecone service.
// Use NewClient to create a Client instance.
type Client struct { ... }

// CreateServerlessIndex creates a new serverless Pinecone index.
// The context controls the lifetime of the request.
func (c *Client) CreateServerlessIndex(ctx context.Context, req *CreateServerlessIndexRequest) (*Index, error) { ... }
```

**Example functions** (appear in godoc as runnable examples):
```go
func ExampleClient_CreateServerlessIndex() {
    pc, _ := pinecone.NewClient(pinecone.NewClientParams{ApiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY"})
    // ...
}
```

**Content:** Start with what the symbol does (brief description), then how/when to use it, then examples. Include a concrete usage example for public methods where helpful.

**Timeless content:** Avoid dates and phrases like "new" or "recently added" in GoDoc. Focus on behavior, not when it was introduced.
