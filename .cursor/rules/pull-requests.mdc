# Pull Request Style

**PRs are documentation:** Write for SDK users, not just reviewers. PRs are linked from release notes.

**Title:** Use Conventional Commits format: `type: description`. Breaking changes: `feat!: require spec parameter`. Keep under 72 characters.

**Description:** Include a clear explanation, realistic Go code examples, and link to related issues. Explain why the change matters, not just what changed.

**Breaking changes:** Add `!` to title AND include `BREAKING CHANGE:` in description with migration path.

**Metadata:** Apply GitHub label. Link issues with `Fixes #123`.
