# Commit Message Style

**Format:** Use Conventional Commits: `type: description`. For breaking changes, add `!`: `feat!: require spec parameter`. Keep subject under 72 characters, imperative mood.

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`

**Body:** Explain why the change was made, not what. Wrap at 72 characters. Separate subject and body with a blank line.

**Breaking changes:** Start body with `BREAKING CHANGE:` and describe the migration path.

**References:** Link issues at end of body: `Fixes #123` or `Refs #456`.
