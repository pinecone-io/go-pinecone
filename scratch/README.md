# Scratch Directory

This directory is for **temporary, experimental, and agent-generated files** that should not be committed to version control.

## Purpose

Use this directory for:

- **Test scripts** - Quick one-off scripts to verify behavior
- **Experimental code** - Prototypes and proof-of-concepts
- **Agent-generated files** - Temporary markdown reports, analysis outputs, etc.
- **Debug utilities** - Helper scripts for troubleshooting
- **Temporary data** - Sample JSON responses, test data files

## Important

- This entire directory is gitignored (except this README)
- Files here are **not tracked in version control**
- Do not put production code or documentation here
- Clean up periodically - this is not an archive

## For AI Assistants

When generating temporary files, test scripts, or experimental code during development, place them in this directory rather than the project root. This keeps the working tree clean and prevents accidental commits of temporary files.
